As society grows more complex, individuals are prompted to acquire expertise on narrower domains. It follows that experts are more knowledgeable in their domain of expertise than non-experts. However, we often see people (e.g., on TV) providing insights on domains beyond the scope of their expertise - a phenomenon coined epistemic trespassing. The "experts" that provided commentary on epidemics throughout the pandemic are the ones who then talked about military strategy in the wake of the war in Ukraine.In this line of research, we explore whether people trust epistemic trespassers and the characteristics that might make them appear more trustworthy.

People tend to ignore epistemic trespassing more for some occupations than others. High status occupations (e.g., surgeon) are granted permission to trespass, but low status occupations (e.g., cashiers) are not trusted when trespassing, such that people trust more high status trespassers talking about low status occupations than the other way around. People are not, however, blind to everything but status: In fact, epistemic trespassing is all the more permissible the more the trespasser's occupation is similar to the one being trespassed (e.g., a surgeon talking about dentists is more trusted than a surgeon talking about detectives). Presently, we are exploring consequences of failed predictions provied by trespassers in the extent to which they are trusted, as well as the psychology behind trespassers feeling entitled to trespass into domains beyond their expertise.
