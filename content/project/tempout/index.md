People have a tendency to see other groups (i.e., outgroups) as more homogeneous than their own (i.e., ingroups), arguably due to increased exposure to the latter that enables them to directly experience dimensions in which ingroup members differ from one another. This is called the outgroup homogeneity effect. In this line of research, we explore the necessary conditions for ingroups to become outgroups, and how this affects perceived group homogeneity.

Our ingroups become outgroups when we think of them in the past. People indicate that their fellow citizens were more similar to one another than their cohort. This is believed to be associated with how we represent the present and the past, namely how we evoke the present to think about the past (but not the opposite), and other relevant cognitive mechanisms.
