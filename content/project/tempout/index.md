People have a tendency to see other groups (i.e., outgroups) as more homogeneous than their own (i.e., ingroups), arguably due to increased exposure to the latter that enables them to directly experience dimensions in which ingroup members differ from one another. This is called the outgroup homogeneity effect. In this line of research, we explore the necessary conditions for ingroups to become outgroups, and how this affects perceived group homogeneity.

The rejection of psychological science emerges due to a mismathc between how it seeks to explain behaviors and how people experience them. This is particularly the case for phenomena with intense phenomenological experiences (e.g., falling in love). The more a domain is seen as being associated with introspection, concretely a feeling of what it is like to experience it that only the perceiver can know, the more it is associated with immaterial parts of people (e.g., sould, spirit, mind). The more something is considered immaterial more than material (e.g., associated with the brain), the less it is believed to be explainable through science. 
These dualistic beliefs about the nature of psychological phenomena are intuitive in nature, so that they emerge more strongly for judgments under timer constraints. When prompted to revise their initial answers, people lean more towards associating material basis with the phenomena, especially for these domains high in introspection. People experience conflict when providing these judgments, especially for domains such as falling in love, as there is some degree of awareness that fast responses (more immaterial-leaning) do not necessarily align with more deliberate judgments (more material-leaning).
