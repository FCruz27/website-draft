abstract: A dual-route account of holistic processing has been proposed, which includes a stimulus-based and experience-based approach to holistic processing. The bottom-up route was suggested by the observation of holistic processing for novel Gestalt line patterns in the absence of expertise. For words, there is mainly evidence for a late, lexical, experience-based locus of holistic processing with scarce evidence for an early, stimulus-based locus. However, salient early Gestalt information (i.e., connectedness, closure, and continuity between parts) are important for letter and word identification. Thus, there might be an overlap at an early, perceptual processing stage, between Gestalt stimulus-based holistic processing and word holistic processing. In the task we used, words and Gestalt line patterns were superimposed, and we evaluated whether one class of stimuli was processed less holistically when an aligned other class pattern (processed holistically) was superimposed. There was some evidence supporting an early locus for the influence of word processing on Gestalt line patterns, but the interaction between the two stimuli was not reciprocal, which needs further clarification. When an aligned word (processed holistically) was overlaid on a line pattern, the line pattern was processed less holistically. However, when an aligned line pattern (processed holistically) was overlaid on a word, the word was not processed less holistically. This pattern might result from the higher cohesiveness of words and their automaticity and feedback from the lexicon.
